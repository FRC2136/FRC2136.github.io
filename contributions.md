# Modifying this site
This site is meant as a central redirection point for all the resources related to team 2136.  The site is built with Jekyll which just requires updating plain text files to update the site.


If you're a team member use a git client (or the github gui client) to clone the site and modify the posts here.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/FRC2136/FRC2136.github.io.git
{% endhighlight %}

Add or modify the pages and run

{% highlight bash %}
git add .
git commit -am "Message of what was changed here for the log"
git push
{% endhighlight %}
